The goal of this challenge is to estimate the pose, i.e., the relative position and attitude, of a known spacecraft from individual grayscale images. The images were generated to capture a variety of poses and illumination conditions and are sourced from two complimentary testbeds to validate the domain adaptation and transferability of the proposed approaches.
